# Automated Pill Dispenser

## Design Goals 

## Project Background
This automated pill dispenser was prototyped and designed in approximately 40 hours of total design time and programming in Northeastern's Cornerstone of Engineering 2 course, an intro course to engineering principles and design that teaches about industry software such as MATLAB, SOLIDWORKS, and ARDUINO, in addition to design and ethics associated with engineering. This project was created by a team of 4, each delegated a role in managing the design and drafting process of our product.
